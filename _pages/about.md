Welcome! I'm Di Yue (<ruby>岳<rt>yuè</rt></ruby>
<ruby>镝<rt>dí</rt></ruby>), 
a fourth-year undergraduate student at [School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Shaofeng Jiang](https://www.shaofengjiang.cn/).
In summer 2024, I spent a wonderful month visiting [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/), where I had the privilege of working with Prof. [Robert Krauthgamer](https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~robi/).

My research interest lies in theoretical computer science, especially computational problems in geometric settings.
Currently, I am working on dimension reduction for geometric optimization problems.

Hopefully I will start doing my Ph.D. this fall in the [theory group](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/theory/) at University of Toronto, under the supervision of [Sasho Nikolov](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~anikolov/).
